<h1>About this game</h1>

<h2>Who's the developper ?</h2>
<p>
I'm a Belgian student in Engineering, fond of software development for a few years and habitual gamer. This is my first game released ever, 
so it's probably not exactly as polished as a professionnal version. :) <br/>
Feel free to suggest improvements, I've mostly developped this app for the purpose of gaining experience ! 
(After all, by creating another Snake clone, I didn't expect to create the most innovative game.)

<h2>How to support him ?</h2>
<p>
    Obivously, there isn't any paid content in this game. All you can do is rate this application, and that would be much appreciated !
